# Math:
# Chebyschev's Inequality:
#       Let X be an (integrable?) variable with expected value u and finite non-
#       zero variance o^2. Then for any real number k > 0,
#       Pr(|X - u| >= ko) <= 1/k^2
#
# Markov's Inequality:
#       Let X be a non-negative random variable and a > 0, then,
#       Pr(X >= a) <= E(X) / a
