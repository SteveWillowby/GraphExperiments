The graphs come in pairs, which are recognizable by the last index in the file name.

This allows a performance analysis of solvers for which only an isomorphism test is available and no canonization option.

For the "cfi-rigid-r2" and "cfi-rigid-t2" series these pairs are isomorphic.

For the other families the graphs come (with high probability) in pairs of non-isomorphic graphs.
